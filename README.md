A Solid app containing various very-simple client-side tools. Created by me, or AI (but mostly me - just trust me bro 🙄)

No tracking, no cookies, no data send out. All processing is done in your browser. All tools can work offline (if all pages are loaded).

See all: <https://tools.ducng.dev>

_This is just a playground where I implement all the things I ~~'m learning~~ like ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯_

## Tools

Paste or select a .csv file to dispaly it in a table 🤷‍♂️ with pagination and filtering
