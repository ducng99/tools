A React app containing various very-simple client-side tools. Created by me 👨‍💻, or AI 🤖 (but mostly me - just trust me 👀)

No tracking, no cookies, no data send out. All processing is done in your browser. All tools can work offline (if all pages are loaded).<br/>
PWA coming soon™

*This is just a playground where I implement all the things I'm ~~learning~~ like ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯*
