A Solid app containing various very-simple client-side tools. Created by me, or AI (but mostly me - just trust me bro 👀)

No tracking, no cookies, no data send out. All processing is done in your browser. All tools can work offline (if all pages are loaded).

*This is just a playground where I implement all the things I ~~'m learning~~ like ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯*
